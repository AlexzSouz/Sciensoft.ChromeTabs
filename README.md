Save your Chrome tabs for later, and avoid the need to bookmark unwanted pages anymore üòÅ.

Save Chrome Tabs allows you to save and organize all your windows and tabs in a single place. You can save unlimited tabs groups free of charge, and it's ad-free. It also synchronizes all your saved tabs groups with other devices.

And very importantly, this extension does not collect any data. It basically uses Chrome APIs to see your tabs and save them in your Chrome storage.
